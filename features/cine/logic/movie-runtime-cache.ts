/**
 * How long each film lasts, looked up once and kept for good.

 * A review stores the TMDB id and nothing about the film itself, so the only way to add up hours is
 * to ask TMDB — and asking for fifty films every time the dashboard opens would be absurd for a
 * number that never changes. A film's runtime is a fact about the film, not about the collection,
 * so it is cached by id and shared by everything that needs it.
 *
 * Best effort throughout: a lookup that fails is simply not cached, so the total is short until the
 * next visit rather than wrong forever, and nothing here can stop the dashboard from rendering.
