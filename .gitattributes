# 1. Auto-detect text files and normalize line endings
# Git will handle the conversion between Windows (CRLF) and Linux/WSL (LF) automatically.
* text=auto eol=lf

# 2. Force bash scripts to always use LF
# Essential for WSL to run scripts correctly.
*.sh text eol=lf

# 3. Force Windows batch scripts to always use CRLF
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# 4. Binary files (images, videos, etc.)
# Git should not try to convert line endings or diff these files as text.
